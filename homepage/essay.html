        <h1>Write Your New York - Gabriel Lev</h1>
        <p>January, 2017. My dad and I walked out of his old art studio. A hobby painter for years, he was forced out of his old studio because the building was being sold and refurbished for some company. However, this condition was short lived, since he struck gold by getting a studio space at Culture Lab, which was then called LICArts. The space he got was not large, and also shared, but it was plenty to get by. It was only a few blocks from where we live in Long Island City, not to mention that it was rent free. To this day, none of that has changed.</p>
        <p>Long Island City was once an industry town, and Culture Lab is in one of the last few warehouses from that era. With 2 galleries and a parking lot, event space is in surplus. Ever since it was renamed in 2019, there have been outside and indoor events ranging from musical performances to art open houses and even dance. When space is not being used, it’s free for anyone around. Because of this, on mornings in the summer of 2020, I was fortunate enough to go to the second gallery just about every day to use a baby grand piano to practice on. If something’s not being used, just make sure that it goes back to where it came from.</p>
        <p>The kind of events that Culture Lab conducts are impressive to say the least. What's more is that while many other galleries might have hired a group of people to set up shows or events, at Culture Lab, it is up to volunteers and the artists themselves to make it all happen. Earlier on, my dad would help set up things like artwork, chairs, etc. However, as I became a more active member of the community when I entered 9th grade, I became a volunteer. For community service time, I would be outside in the early August midday sun on an empty, black, radiating parking lot on a cloudless day, throwing down chairs from the back of a truck. Other people would be helping around, doing equally hard work, but there wouldn’t be a peep about the conditions. At the end, lots of people would show up, and we could enjoy the work we put in and be satisfied with what came of it.</p>
        <p>Now, to manage the enigma that is logistics, specialization in many fields is needed. Edjo, the community manager, is in charge of everything overall. With a fun but business attitude, he keeps the place organized, plans events, and generally runs the whole show. Tess is the director of events, giving orders to me and other volunteers. There are plenty of cooks, bartenders, artists, musicians and others who are the lifeblood of the community, but it is their excellent independent performance in their role that makes them stand out.</p>
        <p>Living in NYC and being at a community arts center with an extroverted father, I have come to get opportunities when it comes to music, my particular study. Martin, my dad's friend who is a music teacher at an NYC public high school and plays saxophone at Culture Lab, offered to teach me privately, which I did for a good while. Not only did I get better at saxophone, but I made a new contact with someone who is willing to help with any future concerns I had regarding music. Culture Lab not only gives space for the arts, but connections too.</p>
